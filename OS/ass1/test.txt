Write a shell script that accepts a file name as an input and performs the following activities
on the given file. The program asks for a string of characters (that is, any word) to be provided
by the user. The file will be searched to find whether it contains the given word. If the file
contains the given word, the program will display (a) the number of occurrences of the word.
The program is also required to display (b) the line number in which the word has occurred
and no. of times the word has occurred in that line (Note: the word may occur more than once
in a given line). If the file does not contain the word, an appropriate error message will be
displayed.
